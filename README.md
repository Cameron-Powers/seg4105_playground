### Team Retrospective done here:
https://github.com/ruwanidealwis/seg4105_project/wiki/Winning-Pitch#retro

### Retrospective
- What things did you do that think were awesome and should keep doing
    - Efficient meetings and team communication went well, good frequency of meetings as well
    - Good async communication as well
    - Good estimation skills as all features were achieved
    - Well shaped project
    - Solid peer reviewing of code
- What are things you think you should stop doing, and why
    - Familiarizing and setting up the project environment
    - Under estimated how long it would take and errors that we came across took some time to resolve.
    - More commenting on code to better explain what we all did
- What new things would you like to try out?
    - Better set of standards for documentation
    - Branch naming and code commit, PR formatting and structure
    - Issue tracking and code commenting
    - Unit testing and other more outlined tests, rather than individual manual testing
- What are things that are affecting your team but are outside your scope of control
    - Absent team members
    - New project, no pipelines or familiarity with the project for most members, took time for everyone to get up to speed
    - Different schedules made meeting times random
