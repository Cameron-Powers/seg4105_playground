## Brightspace Change
I think brightspace is a great software for school, however the number of notifications one one class page can be very distracting. What would be a great feature is the ability to mark any work as "completed". Currently on the site, if a user opens a slide show or some other item uploaded by the prof, the item is considered "completed". However, assignments or deliverables that never receive a submission will remain in the "overdue" state all semester as seen in the image below.

With a lot of work, especially in software related courses having github repos as the point of submission, there is no option to remove this notification. Thus, having a check box on the page to allow the student to mark it on their own(perhaps the option is only available after the due date is past) would be a great addition
