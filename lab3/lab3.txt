### Things I Liked
What I enjoyed seeing is the fact there is nothing too much set in stone. The idea of having everything at a higher level allows for more creativity as everything is still abstract. Furthermore, the idea of not having an exact number of hours to fit a project/ feature into allows for the team to be a lot more agile when working. With the project being a little more abstract, the developer can better weigh design and implementation costs as it relates to the value that components provide to the client/overall project.

### Things I Disliked
The one thing I was not a fan of was the unspecific nature of some features. As a designer for a project, it may be difficult to portray what your concept of a well completed job is without setting any form of criteria to determine it. If there is any form of disconnect between the designers and those who end up implementing and developing the actual project, there may be a lack of execution if the entire idea is not passed on well. Being agile is great when it comes to requirements but there still needs to be a success criteria outlined

### Open Ended Q
Some projects would have a defined scope from the start, so how would the idea of fixed time, variable scope still be optimal?

Why is the project specifically capped at 6 weeks? Why not 4 or 8 weeks? What's the advantage of having the time set at 6 weeks exactly?
